## Episode 1

Impression: There were too many obvious problems in how the story was told. It
seems like the creators never thought about what they wanted watchers to feel
and think. In my imagination, they made a storyboard of events from the original
cartoon, scored each event by plot progression and filming costs, cut the bottom
30%, chronologically reordered the remaining 70%, and stitched in new events to
make it make sense. In doing so, they lost the magic.

The original Avatar was very much a character-driven show; I related to and
formed a connection with the squad and their nemesies. I even found joy the
eclectic mix of side characters who brought life to the universe. It was a
privilege to join them on their journeys of adventure, discovery, and growth.
The changes I described in Netflix's remake lost that.

The good

- I liked the casting
- Special effects were awesome

The bad

- Randomly skipped meaningful scenes and introduced pointless scenes/details you
  don't care about
  - Prelude ruins journey of discovery by telling you the past
    - Random earthbender dude sends news of invasion and is captured and fire
      lord sozin details his plan to prisoner for no discernible reason; went
      overboard telling us instead of letting the show... show us
    - Made up comet festival to get airbenders to southern air temple
    - 100-year-old drama about Aang before we have a chance to learn and care
      about him
    - Lost notion of being unable to accept reality until he has no choice; this
      is critical to the story since his past failure is a source of motivation
      and trauma (drama)
  - Return via kayak, not aapa, and skipping moment in original show where sokka
    says "yip yip"
  - Gran-gran gives a scary lecture about Avatar and airbenders
    - But then doesn't say Aang is the Avatar until later for dramatic effect
- Did not make good changes where it could help
  - Wouldn't hurt to make Aang and squad older; it's hard to suspend belief
    about children surviving on their own, let alone saving the world
- Way too serious and not enough lightheartedness despite the show being about
  children
-
