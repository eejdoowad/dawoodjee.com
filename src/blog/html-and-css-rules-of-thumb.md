This post defines a core set of practical and opinionated rules for designing
quality User Interfaces with HTML and CSS. The intent is to reduce the need for
research and critical thinking by providing informed answers to fundamental
design questions you'll commonly encounter, like:

- Which default style resets should be applied to every page?
- How should you pick a font-family?
- When should you pick between serif, sans-serif, and monospace fonts?
- How should text be sized and with which css dimension?
- How should you pick word spacing, line-height, and vertical spacing between
  blocks?
- How should text overflow and wrap?
- How should the width and height of various page elements be chosen and with
  which css dimension?
- How should you pick between padding and margins
- (How) should you use responsive design and which screen sizes should you
  design for?
- How much padding should there be around the viewport?
- When should I use inline, block, inline-block, flex, and grid?
- How should headers be sized and should headers be fixed?
- How should HTML be loaded?
- How should CSS be loaded?
- How should images be loaded?
- How should theming be supported?
- How should semantic HTML be used?
  - Conrete examples where it makes a difference for SEO and accessibility
  - Recognition of cost-benefit tradeoff: investing in accessibility is not
    universally always the best thing you can do
- Core HTML elements to use
- How to write CSS selectors, how to order css rules, when to rely on
  inheritence and resets
- Color and opacity rules
- A little about design tokens, css variables, tailwind, component libraries
- Internationalization, non-english and RTL concerns

Out-of-scope

- Templating/rendering framework: Raw HTML, react, angular, handlebars, jinja
- Styling framework: Raw CSS, SASS, Tailwind, Styled Components

Maybe adjust guidance based on requirements:

- Target platform: desktop app, mobile app, desktop and mobile website
