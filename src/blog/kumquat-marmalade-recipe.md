## Steps

1. Wash kumquats and remove blemishes

   overnight in the fridge

## Notes

- All quantities are guesstimates
- 1-to-1 is the standard mixture to sugar ratio, but we like it less sweet
- Granulated sugar also works, but we prefer cane sugar
- Make sure to sanitize jars before use
- 8 oz mason jars are the right size
- In the future, we'll experiment with spices like saffron, cardamom, star
  anise, and cinnamon
