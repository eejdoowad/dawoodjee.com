For a while now, I’ve wanted to create a blog to write about topics I think are interesting or might be useful to others. This website is the result of that desire, and this post explains why and how.

Ownership of your content is important. I am philosophically, and practically, opposed to communicating on a platform controlled by someone else. Practically, this would be a social media platform like Medium, Substack, or DEV Community. The problem for me is that I lose control over how my content is communicated to users, and platform owners have incentives in conflict with mine.

Platforms exist to make money. Not always at their inception, but eventually server bills are due and emails land in your inbox offering payment for views or data. In the long run it’s hard to impossible to ignore these incentives in favor of a purist vision, and before you know it (or more likely you’re conscious and aware of it), your platform’s vision becomes monitization.

In pursuit of monetization, platforms attempt to maximize time users spend on them because more time means more ad views, more valuable user data collection, and more importance of your platform in the lives of your users (and thus more willingness to invest in your platform). You keep people on your platform via engagement.
