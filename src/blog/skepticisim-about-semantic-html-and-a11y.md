WHo is HTML for? Humans or machines? Are normal humans really capable of writing
accessible HTML or is the domain of motivated professionals? Should mortals even
try? Is perfect the enemy of good and is progressive enhancement good enough?
Semantic html is often wrong and often ignored in favor of heuristics/automated
algorithms. The question of incentives: legal mandate, SEO supposedly, nobody
ever says accessibilty is a waste of time, lots of people say it's suuuuper
important. In a world of limited resources, how should we balance need and cost?
Any take aways or is this just a rant? What is better and how can we achieve it?
