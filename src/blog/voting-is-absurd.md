title: Voting is Absurd
draft: true

Reasons

- Requires people to believe in efficacy of voting system
- Requires people to bother
- Requires people to bother to inform themselves to make decisions
- Requires information to be quality and accessible
- Requires educated people
- Democratic voting systems are fundamentally deeply flawed; they don't
  represent the will of the poeple, e.g. first-past-the-post, plurality,
  non-proportional representation like senate
  - TODO: elaborate why
- Democratic voting systems are universally and shamelessly gamed, sabotaged,
  exploited, abused by those in power
  - gerrymandering
  - voter suppression (TODO: elaborate many different types)
  - not voter fraud (at least not in non-corrupt places where it can be easily
    identified and combatted)
- Politicians make their own voting system (and never change a system that put
  them in power)
- Heavily favors incumbent politicians
- Political activism skews to the wealthy, older, and non-working people who
  have the extra time and resources
  - Great for maintaining interests of the incumbent and well-to-do, at the
    expense of new-comers and non-wealthy
- Party interests are prioritized over civic interests

But then what's better?

- Sortition
- Benevolent dictator?
- Direct democracy in educated, informed, constitutional, no-propoganda system?
